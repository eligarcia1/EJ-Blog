## Access to Green Spaces through an Environmental Justice Lens

This blog will explore different maps of the built environment, and how these maps can be improved and used as social justice interventions.

My research interest is on accessibility to green spaces in Oakland. Minimal research has been done on accessibility to green spaces in Oakland, most environmental justice maps have focused on pollution burden in the area. 

I want to discuss how the built environment's relation to helping mitigate environmental hazards like pollution, but also other ways the built environemnt affects community health and the importance of access to green spaces.

Access to green spaces for marginalized communities is both a social justice and environmental justice intervention that helps community health and wellbeing.

This map of Oakland uses an analysis of CalEnviroScreen 1.0
CalEnviroScreen has been updated to CalEnviroScreen 4.0 since this map has been made.

This map describes cumulative impacts as "a technical term to describe the lived reality in many low-income communities and communities of color." These impacts include economic and social stress and well as pollution burden.
